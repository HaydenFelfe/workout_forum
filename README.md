## Roadmap 
- Create workout routines that can be viewed online by other people.
- Save, comment and like other routines to have it save within your workout plan.
- View dynamic warm up exercises before you begin your workout day. A minimum of 5-8 minutes of warm ups is highly recommended without fatiguing yourself before the actual workout begins!
