Lift your right knee and rotate your leg so your shin is parallel to the floor, grabbing your right ankle with your left hand near your hip. Keep your right hand on your right knee, gently “cradling” and pulling the leg up toward your chest. Release, step forward with the right leg and repeat on the other side.",

Grab behind the right knee with your left hand to hold it down. Stretch your right arm out to your right side, laying it flat on the floor (with your palm facing upward), and look towards it. Keeping your right arm straight, bring it over to your left side to touch the floor palm down. Turn your head to follow your right hand throughout the motion",
